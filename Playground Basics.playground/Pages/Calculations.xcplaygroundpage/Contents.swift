## Calculations
You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.

You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:

34 + 56 + 230

1000 - 300

10-3
2021 - 1984
-31 + 50

/*:
These signs are formally known as *arithmetic operators*. The `+` operator performs an addition operation on the two values to either side.
The asterisk `*` is the multiplication operator:
 */
3 * 100

//eu
7 * 3
2 * 5
-2 * 5


//: The division operator is the slash `/`. (If the two numbers don't divide evenly, the remainder is discarded.)
24 / 8

17 / 3

//eu

200 / 10
10 / 200

//: Note that Swift observes the standard precedence of operations: `*` and `/` before `+` and `-`.
2 * 5 + 8

8 + 2 * 5

1+3+4*2/5
4*3-5+12/3


//: And it performs same-precedence operations in order from left to right:
120 / 6 * 2

//
//: There's also a special `%` operator to calculate the remainder of a division. (You'll learn more about practical uses of the remainder, or *modulo*, operator later in this course.)
12 % 5

//eu
50 % 5
10 % 3

//: The remainder operator observes the same precedence as multiplication and division.
12 % 5 + 4 / 2

//eu
10 % 2 * 3 / 4
10 % 3 * 3 / 4

//: For grouping, use parentheses `( )`, which take precedence over all other operators:
(8 + 2) * 5
120 / (6 * 2)
(300 + 500 + 400) / (6 / 2)

 - Experiment: 
Practice using the playground like a calculator.
Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
